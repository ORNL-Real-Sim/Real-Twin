  abstractNote = {Real-Twin is a unified, model-agnostic scenario generation tool designed to streamline and standardize the evaluation of emerging mobility technologies. It provides an end-to-end framework that includes robust workflows, integrated tools, and comprehensive metrics to generate, calibrate, and benchmark microscopic traffic simulation scenarios across multiple platforms. Key Features of Real-Twin include: - Unified Scenario Generation: generate transferable, simulation-ready scenarios from heterogeneous data sources using a consistent workflow. - Automated Calibration Workflow: bridges simulation and real-world data, minimizing manual effort and making traffic simulation more accessible to researchers and engineers. - Model-Agnostic Compatibility: supports SUMO, VISSIM, and AIMSUN for cross-platform scenario generation and benchmarking. Enables reliable comparisons and reproducibility across different simulation tools. - Consistent Scenarios across Different Simulators: generate comparable simulation scenarios across different microscopic traffic simulators, providing users the ability to conduct benchmarking and cross-validation that are crucial for ensuring the reliability and reproducibility of simulation results. - Emerging Technology Support: includes a scenario database and pipeline for studying autonomous vehicles (AVs), with planned extensions to CAVs, EVs, and other advanced technologies.},

Real-Sim framework connects different simulation components and integrates various traffic and vehicle simulation tools, virtual environments, and XIL systems through a Flexible Interface for XIL Simulation (FIXS). Connections among different tools are transparent to users and handled by the interface behind the scenes. Co-simulation of various vehicle and traffic simulation tools with different XIL systems can be easily achieved and become a transparent "plug-and-play" process to users.},
